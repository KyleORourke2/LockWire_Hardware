Description:
Code for the the LockWire bike lock running on a DragonBoard 410c
and an Arduino Uno. The Arduino is linked via a serial USB
connection to the DragonBoard running processing software that
pushes relevent data to our server. Theft detection can be handled
in real time on the Arduino or DragonBoard.
